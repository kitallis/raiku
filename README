My little experiments on trying to bind the C++ Haiku API. Currently only tested on Ruby1.9, which can be 
downloaded from http://www.haiku-ports.de/packages/dev-lang/ruby/ruby-1.9.1-x86-gcc2-2009-10-28.zip

There is an unresolved problem with the shared object file generation, apart from that, the HelloWorld.rb 
works fine through these steps :

> ruby extconf.rb 
> make (will generate HelloWorld.o and a lot of warnings :| ; would also fail to create a shared object 
file, which can be resolved by manually calling gcc)
> gcc -shared Rb_Application.o -o Rb_Application.so
> ruby HelloWorld.rb

There are some tests/ as well, which would be updated as I constantly learn the Ruby C API (which seems 
pretty nice to use up till now :D) and they can be compiled similarly.

I would probably be moving into using Rice as an automater for certain things as I learn the Ruby C API, 
which would make certain linkings easier. But I'd need to obviously port it before :|
